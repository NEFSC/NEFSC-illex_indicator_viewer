# NEFSC *Illex* Indicator Viewer
This repository is for the development and management of the *Illex* Indicator Viewer created by the Northeast Squid Squad. The *Illex* Indicator Viewer serves two purposes, the first of which is to display near-real-time oceanographic conditions in the Northwest Atlantic. Secondly, this report will serve as a living document in which to record weekly observations on current oceanographic features and fishing condition from experts in the region.

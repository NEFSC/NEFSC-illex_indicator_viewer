## Body weight trends across years
***

A quick look at the average body weight data from 1997 through 2019. The data
were derived via subsamples collected from landings from various Illex 
processors. Colors correspond to Paul Rago's qualitative measures of system state, where green indicates  a 'Good' year, pink an 'Average' year and blue a 'Poor' year.

# 2021 Case Study

> JULY 25- 31: Industry noted that squid seemed to have disappeared off the 
shelf after being present in high abundance for the last few months. 

Looking into the oceanographic conditions, team realized there was an increase
in sea surface temperature of about 5 degrees over the course of one week. 
Additionally, they noted continued westward propagation of warm ring/GS water,
hypothesized to be dispersing or redistributing the squid.

Below are some figures generated and annotated by Avijit Gangopadhyay and
Glen Gawarkiewicz

Avijit noted: Temperature along the shelfbreak
(from SNE to south of Georges Bank) was about 75F on 7/23/21, increases to
about 78-80 on 7/26/21 with mostly westward flow along the shelf break 
(below Georges Bank) with another WCR covering the SNE shelf (this WCR has 
colder shelf water in its core – this happened due to the WCR entraining a 
shelf streamer the previous week). Finally, the whole shelfbreak seems to be
warm with temperature at about 79-81 all along SNE and South of the
Northeast Channel.

+ There is an overall tendency of the warm GS/Ring water flowing westward and 
flooding the shelfbreak. Is this interacting or part of the shelf break jet 
itself? 

+ High temperature all along the shelf break with a train of along-shelf 
features more like a warm blob. Could it be a new marine heat wave?


**In-situ Salinity time series for the  month of July 2021 (from Pioneer Array)**
![](/Users/sarah.salois/Documents/github/ssalois1/NEFSC-illex_indicator_viewer/images/salinity/pa_0721.png)

Glen noted: "About a week ago there was a big drop (nearly 1 psu) in salinity at
the inshore Pioneer Array mooring at 7 m depth. This is indicative of a big
retreat of the slope/ring water. The salinity dropped from around 34.2 to 
around 33.2 on July 27. Salinities on the outer shelf were very high during 
the Armstrong cruise the second half of June. The shelf break front was in an 
anomalously shoreward position, probably 20 NM shoreward of the usual position
during the Armstrong cruise June 18-July 2. The shelf break front also was 
anomalously onshore south of Hudson Canyon recently from Rutgers glider
transects. What is interesting over the past 2-3 months is the large number of 
rings. Ring influence on the outer shelf has been pronounced throughout the 
entire MAB. I wonder if the front popping back to its normal position has 
occurred over a large area. We will have to think about ways to test this
(altimeter?)."

+ This is really important to figure out why a pulse would end as well as why
it would begin.

Avijit's response: "We should look at altimetry. Contours and their movement as 
well as cross track velocities which will resolve the SBF better. That will tell
us a lot. We could also look at winds! And offshore changes might be captured
by the few argo floating in these rings. Their trajectories might have changed
from a ring-silo configuration to a ring-coalescence configuration." 


> AUGUST 7, 2021 : Industry reports fishing has resumed, starting in a piece of
water around Wilmington and Spencers canyon.

JM: The fishing was reportedly not as good as it was a month prior and one 
harvester reported seeing a change in size frequency of fish available during 
the last trip from larger to smaller.
